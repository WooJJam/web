<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written<br>
in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).<br>
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. </p>
<img src="html.jpg" alt = "코딩이미지"width="70%">
<p style = "margin-top: 60px">CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>
This separation can improve content accessibility; <br>
provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; <br>
enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition <br>
 in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share <br>
 the file and its formatting. </p>
